/*
In this exercise, a string is passed to a method and a new string has to be returned with the first character of each word in the string.
For example:
"This Is A Test" ==> "TIAT"

Developer's note:
learning:
1. different types of accumulator passing to reduce method
2. String function charAt

*/

function makeString(s){
  return s.split(' ').reduce((finalStr,subStr) =>(finalStr += subStr.charAt(0)),'');
}
