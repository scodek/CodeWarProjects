### About CodeWars
"Codewars is a community of developers, who are called Code Warriors (or just warriors), that train on improving their development skills. Think of it like a coding dojo - where developers train with each other and help each other get better through practice." - from [CodeWar wiki](https://github.com/Codewars/codewars.com/wiki/About-Codewars)
